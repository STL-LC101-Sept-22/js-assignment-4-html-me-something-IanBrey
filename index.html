         <h1>My Favourite Choir Songs I've Performed</h1>
         <h3>Posted by Ian Brey</h3>
         <p>In all of my primary education and college years, choir has been a constant all throughout. In high school, I was in my schools chamber and jazz choirs, and in college, I was in the smaller audition choir. Singing and being part of these groups is something special I will always hold close at heart and some of the songs I've performed still linger in my head. Here are some of my favorites:</p>

            <h2>Afternoon On a Hill (Eric Barnum)</h2>
            <p>Using the poem by Edna St. Vincet Millay as lyrics, Barnum's choral composition of Afternoon on a Hill evokes the feelings of being out on a grassy field, enjoying nature in its entirety.<br>
            The song features a very unique technique: A full choir slide. Difficult to pull off, this movement creates such a pure and uplifting feeling I've never felt in any other song.

            <h2>Soon Ah Will Be Done (Arr. William Dawson)</h2>
            <p>An old slave song arranged for choir, this a capella piece has two distinct parts. The first is quiet but very percussive and drives forward the energy into the second part, a fortissimo wail.
            When I was in elementary school, I heard the high school choir perform this and it is what inspired me to want to stay in choir and get good at singing.

            <h2>Take Five (Arr. Kirby Shaw)</h2>
            <p>Arranged from the jazz standard of the same name by Dave Brubeck, Take Five is a groovy song in the unusual time signature 5/4. A joy to listen to and to sing.</p>

            <h2>The Battle of Jericho (Arr. Moses Hogan)</h2>
            <p>Another slave song based on the biblical battle of Jericho. This song is very bombastic all throughout, symbolic of its namesake.</p>

            <h2>The Twelve Days After Christmas (Frederick Silver)</h2>
            <p>Not your normal christms song, the Twelve Days <em>After</em> Christmas is a playful telling of the song of the similar name with lines like <br>
               &quot;The third day after Christmas, my mother caught the coup.<br>
               We had to use the three french hens to make some chicken soup.&quot;<br>
               This song never fails to get laughs out of the crowd.

            <h2>Carol of the Bells (Mykola Leantovych)</h2>
            <p>An actual classic christmas song, I've always loved this one. My choir performed this song every year and it was something I always looked forward to.</p>

            <h2>Run To You (Pentatonix)</h2>
            <p>A more recent a capella song, Run To You is a very slow moving, mostly unison song, but the chords it strikes feel very impactful.
               This one was very fun to perform because the bass part (my vocal part) was quite low which let me shine, being the lowest voice in my choir.

            <h2>Dear Sarah (James Syler)</h2>
            <p>My personal favorite of this list. Dear Sarah was originally a letter from Sullivan Ballou to his beloved wife, Sarah Ballou, in the midst of the Civil War
               The letter shares how he loves Sarah, how he misses her every day yet, and how if he were to die, his spirit would forever flit around her.
               Hauntingly, the day after the letter was sent, a Confederate attack resulted in Sullivan losing his life.<br>
               My chamber choir performed this song at Seattle City Hall and received a standing ovation as it finished. This song will always be special to me.
