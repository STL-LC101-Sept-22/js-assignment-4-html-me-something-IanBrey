         <h1>My Favourite Choir Songs I've Performed</h1>
         <h3>Posted by Ian Brey</h3>
         <p>In all of my primary education and college years, choir has been a constant all throughout. In high school, I was in my schools chamber and jazz choirs, and in college, I was in the smaller audition choir. Singing and being part of these groups is something special I will always hold close at heart and some of the songs I've performed still linger in my head. Here are some of my favorites:</p>

      <h2>Afternoon On a Hill (Eric Barnum)</h2>
      <p>Using the poem by Edna St. Vincet Millay as lyrics, Barnum's choral composition of Afternoon on a Hill evokes the feelings of being out on a grassy field, enjoying nature in its entirety.
         The song features a very unique technique: A full choir slide. Difficult to pull off, this movement creates such a pure and uplifting feeling I've never felt in any other song.
